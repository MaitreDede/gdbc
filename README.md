(VERY MUCH WIP - This doesn't work yet)

# GDBC - Golang JDBC Driver Wrapper

## What?
Allows you to load and use Java database drivers from go.

## How?
Uses GraalVM to compile the driver as a native library, then CGO to communicate with it.

## Why?
Because there are some databases that don't have go drivers.

## Why really?
Because it's fun.

## When?
This is a side project, so it may take a while.
